The Mod. N625 is a 1-unit NIM module which houses:  
- Four linear 4 Input + 4 Output Fan in/Fan out sections
- One 1 Channel Discriminator

Each Fan in/Fan out section produces on all its output connectors, the sum of the signals fed to the inputs, multiplied for the selected gain factor (1 or -1, jumper selectable).
Gain = 1 (non inverting mode) and gain = -1 (inverting mode) are signalled by LEDs.

Fan in/Fan out inputs are bipolar, both input and output signals are DC coupled.

Moreover each Fan in/Fan out section features a screwdriver trimmer which allows the DC offset (“zero”) adjustment.

**The discriminator channel has one DC coupled input, an internal jumper allows to perform the slope coupling on either the leading or the trailing edge; the threshold is screwdriver adjustable and monitorable via test point; the output is NIM standard, its width is screwdriver adjustable as well.**

The discriminator In/Out connectors are placed on the back panel, while its controls are on the front panel.
