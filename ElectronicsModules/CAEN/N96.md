# CAEN N96  8 CHS DISCRIMINATOR

说明书 [N96](/pdf/ElectronicsModules/CAEN/n96_rev0.pdf)


Model N96 is an 8-channel fast discriminator, with std NIM outputs

High or low impedance imputs ordering options are available; with high impedance it is possible to cascade multiple sections(a 50 Ω termination is required on the last unit of the daisy-chain).

On each section it is possible to adjust both the threshold level and the output pulse width: the selection of the full scale range is made by a single DIP switch on the PCB for the threshold level(total range 20-380mV) and by a DIP-2 switch for the output width(total range 7-300 ns). Both paprameters can then be continuously adjusted via the front-panel trimmers THR and WDT.

Each section has also a Test Point(TP) to monitor the threshold level on a DC voltmeter.Three outputs(2 nornal,1 complementary logic) are available per channel.

## INput characteristics

- Nunber .. 1 high or low impedance
- Threshold .. continuously adjustable via front-panel trimmer THR over two ranges selected by DIP switch on PCB. Range is 20 to 380 mV.

## Output characteristic

- Number .. 2 normal, 1 complementary logic, 50 Ω impedance, std NIM level.
- Rise-Fall Time .. <= 1.6 ns
- Pulse Width .. continuously adjustable with front-panel trimmer WDT over three ranges selected by DIP switch on PCB. Range is 7-300 ns.

## General

- Maximum Rate .. 85 MHz
- Double Pulse Resolution .. 9 ns
- INput-Output Delay .. 16 ns
