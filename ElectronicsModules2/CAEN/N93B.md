# CAEN N93B

说明书 [N93B](/pdf/ElectronicsModules/CAEN/n93b.pdf)

DUAL TIMER - mod 2255B

该插件由**两组**完全相同的触发脉冲产生器组成。可用来调节 NIM 及 ECL 信号的宽度从 50 ns 到 10 s。 

The END-MARKER, a short output pulse at the end of the tiiming cycle, can be uesd for delayed triggering of other units or, if fed back into the START input, it provides a self-running rate generator that can be started and stopped at will.


It is possible to disable start inputs by feeding a NIM signal to the "Veto" input.



## 输入

- START INPUT
	- NIM and ECL,leading edge sensitive.
	- Minimum width 5 ns.
	- Momentary switch for single cycle operation.
- VETO INPUT
	- NIM input
	- NUM ture level at VETO input desables the START input (within +-2ns of START leading edge)
- RESET INPUT
	- NIM input
	- Minimum width: 7 ns (15 ns for recursive operation)
	- It can be applied at any point of the time cycle.
	- Produces END-MARKER

## 输出

- OUTPUTS
	- Two normal independent,one complementary NIM output and one ECL.
- WIDTH
	- 50 ns to 10 s in 9 decade steps, with a potentiometer and locking dial for fine adjustment
	- Accuracy +-10% of full scale, with adequate range overlap.
	- Temperature coefficient: 10^{-3}/^{0}C of setting
	- Switch postion <<无穷>> for bistable opreation
- DEAD TIME
	- Shorter than the cycle time
	- The timer can be triggered well before the ehd of the timing cucle.
- RISE/FALL TIME
	- <= 2 ns
- INPUT-OUTPUT DELAY
	- Delay from Start to leading edge of output,or from Reset to trailing edge,is ~13 ns
- END MARKER
	- NIM and ECL output, 15 ns wide output pulse leading edge is coincident with the trailing edge of output within 2 ns.
	- Can be connected to Start input for free running opreation (sequence activated by the START switch)
- LED
	- Flashes for 0.1 s or output width, whichever is longer.
	- At high rates the lamp has its own flashing rate.
